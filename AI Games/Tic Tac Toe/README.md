# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe – Human vs AI

This is a Python-based Tic Tac Toe game where you can play against an intelligent AI opponent. The AI uses the **Minimax Algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta Pruning** for optimal decision making.

## 🧠 Algorithm Used

### Minimax Algorithm

- The AI explores all possible moves to choose the one that **maximizes its chance of winning** while **minimizing the opponent’s chance**.

### Alpha-Beta Pruning

- This optimizes the Minimax algorithm by **skipping moves that don’t need to be evaluated**, making the AI **faster and more efficient**.

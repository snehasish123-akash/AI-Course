# üéÆ Tic Tac Toe ‚Äì Human vs AI

This is a Python-based Tic Tac Toe game where you can play against an intelligent AI opponent. The AI uses the **Minimax Algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta Pruning** for optimal decision making.

## üéÆ How to Play the Game

- The game board is a **3x3 grid**.  
- You play as **X** and always go first.  
- Click on an empty cell to place your mark (**X**).  
- The AI plays as **O** and will respond immediately after your move.

## üß† Algorithm Used

### Minimax Algorithm

- The AI explores all possible moves to choose the one that **maximizes its chance of winning** while **minimizing the opponent‚Äôs chance**.

### Alpha-Beta Pruning

- This optimizes the Minimax algorithm by **skipping moves that don‚Äôt need to be evaluated**, making the AI **faster and more efficient**.

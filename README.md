# AI-Course
In this Repository (Artificial Intelligent) you can find All the basic code and 3 popular AI game code and also you can find the purpose of this course in brief.

## üéØ Purpose of the Course

The goal of this course is to provide students with both theoretical and hands-on experience in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It focuses on understanding intelligent systems and applying AI algorithms to solve real-world problems. We learn to represent complex problems, implement classical and modern AI algorithms, and analyze their effectiveness in various environments using Python.

## üìö What I Learned from the Course

During this course, I gained knowledge in:

- Understanding AI fundamentals and comparing it with human intelligence.
- Implementing classical search algorithms: DFS, BFS, A*, and Other Cost Search.
- Applying heuristic and local search techniques like Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, and Genetic Algorithms etc.
- Designing and developing AI-based games (Chess, Tic tac toe, Connect_four) using adversarial search (Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning).
- Solving Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) using backtracking.
- Understanding knowledge representation.
- Applying reinforcement learning concepts like Bellman Equation, Policy and Value Iteration
- Using AI tools to create visual content like presentations and videos.
- Collaborating in projects and improving my problem-solving and Python programming skills.
